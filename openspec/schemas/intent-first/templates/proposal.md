# Proposal

## Why

<!-- 1-2 sentences summarising the intent's Problem and Outcome, ending with a
     pointer: "Intent: intent.md" (plus the docs/intents/ path in slice mode).
     Add no motivation the intent does not give. -->

## What Changes

<!-- New capabilities, modifications, removals. Mark breaking changes **BREAKING**.
     Every item must trace to the intent's Outcome or Constraints. -->

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities
<!-- Capabilities being introduced. Use kebab-case for path segments you introduce
     (e.g., user-auth or identity/user-auth) that follow the project's existing
     spec organization. Each creates specs/<capability-path>/spec.md. -->
- `<capability-path>`: <brief description of what this capability covers>

### Modified Capabilities
<!-- Existing capabilities whose REQUIREMENTS are changing (not just implementation).
     Only list here if spec-level behavior changes. Each needs a delta spec file.
     Use the exact existing path under openspec/specs/. Leave empty if no requirement
     changes. A change with no capabilities at all (pure refactor, tooling, docs)
     must set `skip_specs: true` in its .openspec.yaml - openspec validate rejects
     a zero-delta change without that marker. Do not invent a requirement just to
     satisfy validation. -->
- `<existing-capability-path>`: <what requirement is changing>

## Impact

<!-- Affected code, APIs, dependencies, systems -->
